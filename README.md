# PHP Exchange Web Services
The PHP Exchange Web Services library (php-ews) is intended to make communication with Microsoft Exchange servers using Exchange Web Services easier.
 It handles the NTLM authentication required to use the SOAP services and provides an object-oriented interface to the complex types required to form a request.

# Dependencies
* PHP 5.2+
* cURL with NTLM support (7.23.0+ recommended)
* Exchange 2007 or 2010*

**Note: Not all operations or request elements are supported on Exchange 2007.*
